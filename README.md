# [safe-result-boundry](#)

> result boundry, a react hook for automated intelligent redirects  

## Motivation

`safe-result-boundry` provides React's Error Boundaries coupled with a fallback mechanism for redirecting users both to sending/opening a support ticket, and returning them to a best-case closest match result of their original attempted query. If no best-case can be calculated, it should present the user with options as to how to proceed. 

### Example: Incorrect Contract Address

The inital version of this hook works by applying fast-lev matching on a Uniswap Tokenlist for approximating which Token the user was trying to navigate towards.

> [see reactjs docs](reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html)

## Overview

Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in
their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead
of the component tree that crashed. Error boundaries catch errors during
rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors of the whole tree below
them.
